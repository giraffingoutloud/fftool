SUMMARY ANALYSIS
===============================================================================

KEY INSIGHTS FROM THE RANDOM SAMPLE:

1. ELITE TIER ACCURACY: CSV projections for elite players (Bijan, Chase, Daniels, Bowers, McBride, Nacua) generally align with expert consensus, though some undervalue positional advantages.

2. TIER 2 VARIABILITY: Middle-tier players show the most variance between CSV and expert opinion, particularly Drake London (Penix upgrade) and Chase Brown (breakout potential).

3. REPLACEMENT LEVEL CONCERNS: Lower-tier players like Javonte Williams and Cooper Kupp face more uncertainty than CSV projections suggest due to age, injury, or role changes.

4. QUARTERBACK VOLATILITY: QB rankings vary significantly, with rushing ability (Daniels, Fields) providing higher floors than pure passers.

5. POSITIONAL SCARCITY: Tight ends (Bowers, McBride) command premium ADPs due to position scarcity, while kickers and defenses remain late-round afterthoughts.

RECOMMENDATION: Use this data to identify value plays (Chase Brown, Drake London) and avoid potential landmines (Olave injury concerns, Williams committee role) in 2025 fantasy drafts.
