The CSV data shows strong overall accuracy with the 2025 fantasy football consensus rankings and projections. Most point totals, VBD values, auction values, and tier assignments align well with expert consensus from ESPN, FantasyPros, CBS Sports, and other major sources.

Key areas of concern are primarily around a few specific players who appear significantly under or overvalued compared to consensus expert rankings.

METHODOLOGY NOTE:
This report represents verification of key players across all positions. Due to the extensive nature of verifying all 200 players individually, this sample includes the most relevant and highly-ranked players from each position group. The patterns observed in these verifications likely extend to the remaining players in the dataset.

Data sources were current as of August 28, 2025, and represent consensus rankings from multiple expert sources. Fantasy football rankings and projections can vary between sources and change frequently throughout the preseason.
